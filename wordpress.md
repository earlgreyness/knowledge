# Creating custom theme

Outside of configuring WordPress, almost everything you do in WordPress will be in the `wp-content` folder; everything else is core code, and you donâ€™t want to mess with that.

    cd wp-content/themes
    mkdir salesartblog
    cd salesartblog
    touch style.css
    touch index.php
