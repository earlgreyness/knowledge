To run `command` on `in.txt` and save its output in `out.txt` and its stderr in `err.txt` you should run:

    command < in.txt > out.txt 2> err.txt


# Ubuntu 16.04 and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 550 Ti

To add latest open source drivers to apt, issue these commands:

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
    sudo apt-get update

Go to *Applications/Additional Drivers* and enable the latest NVIDIA **open source** driver.

To get rid of vsync issues, run this command:

    nvidia-settings --assign CurrentMetaMode="nvidia-auto-select +0+0 { ForceFullCompositionPipeline = On }"

If you want to apply this permanently, do the following:

    sudo nvidia-xconfig
    sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
